to practice use of server-side APIs by creating a responsive weather app that uses local storage for persistant history of the cities a user has looked up, a 5-day forcast, and dynamic UV index.

# Usage

to use this project please feel free to see the deployed app with link below and in description. To use code for your own projects please feel free to clone to repo to a local directory and find all necessary script in the script.js file in the assets directory.

# Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs</br>
WHEN I search for a city</br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history</br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city</br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index</br>
WHEN I view the UV index</br>
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe</br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city</br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity</br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history</br>
